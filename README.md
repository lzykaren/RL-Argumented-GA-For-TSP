# RL-Argumented-GA-For-TSP

Hello!

This is Ziyan Lin, a graduate student from Johns Hopkins University, majoring in applied math and statistics.

In this repository, there is a group project to find solution of a TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem) by using deep reinforcement learning on local search for TSP, in cooperate with Jinchang Fan, Han Wang, and Xiaoyu Qiao.

One of classical approaches to solve TSP is Genetic Algorithm applying with Lin-Kernighan heuristic. Although this method generates relatively high accuracy for solutions, it is limited by the number of iterations in 2-opt Heuristic. The efficiency of current algorithm only allow small datasets to implement. 

This repository contains all parts of code, and one final report. If you have any question or suggestion, please feel free to contact me. Thank you very much.
